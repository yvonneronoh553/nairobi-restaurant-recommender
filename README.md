## NaiEats

Welcome to **NaiEats** — a smart and fun restaurant recommendation app built using [AWS PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws). It helps Nairobi locals and visitors discover restaurants based on:

-  Cuisine preference
-  Dining vibe (romantic, rooftop, budget-friendly, etc.)
- Special requests (e.g., "good for dates in Westlands")
- "Surprise Me!" button for random, exciting suggestions

## How It Works

This app uses a no-code AI interface powered by **Amazon Titan and Claude models**. The logic relies on prompt engineering to generate curated restaurant suggestions based on user input — or surprise recommendations if you leave the inputs blank or hit the "Surprise Me!" button.
